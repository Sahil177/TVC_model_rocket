# 3D Python Simulation

The control system is designed in such a way that it operates on each axis seperately which should be a valid for small perturbations and so I believed 
it would be worthwhile to have a 3D simulation of the rocket to see how what the expected performance should be like. With this I also developed an interactive animation
of the flight to be able to carefully examine the trajectory.
