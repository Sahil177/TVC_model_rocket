With a strong fascination towards autonomous rocketry, most notably SpaceX and their 
progress with landing rockets I was keen to work on something of my own over the summer after the
end of first year and learn more about what goes into developing such a system. I hence set out to 
build a rocket capable of thrust vectoring for stability since active stability and control 
systems play a critical role in more complex autonomous systems. I went on to design a model of rocket and 2-axis gimbal system 
on SolidWorks, design and put together a flight computer, design control system, develop a simulation and assemble the physical rocket.

## Aspects of the project
- **CAD Design**: I designed a CAD model for the rocket on SolidWorks. I designed the nose, 2-axis gimbal and flight computer holder to 3D print for the rocket.
- **Flight Computer**: PCB designed and assembled, and software for flight computer writted.
- **Control System**: Simulation of system with aerodynamics developed in Matlab & Simulink. Control system for TVC developed.
- **3D Python Simulation**: I developed a 3D animated simulation of the rocket launch
